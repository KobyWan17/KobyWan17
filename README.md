Hello, I'm Koby Winkler.
I'm a 3rd year student at CSUDH working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
I'm pursuing a career in game design, primarily focusing on C# and Unity Development, though
I have experience in Pyhon Java and C as well.
I love making games, everything from the level design and animations to the code-writing and troubleshooting.
Making games is my passion, and I hope that with enough hard work I can do it for a very long time.
